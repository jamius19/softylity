**About**

I always was irritated to deal with all the hassle while installing an app on Linux platforms.

Surely it is powerful, but sometimes I'd rather have a easier way of installing apps (via  **apt-get** ).

It was always my plan to make a  **GUI ** program for this purpose, which would handle all the commands for me under the hood.

So I started this project two days back, and today I'm finished!
I've gave the name "Softylity" for this program. (Software + Utility!)

This app is primarily intended for simpler software installation. In near feature I intend to add some more functionality in this app.

**Source Code**

**It's open source!**





**Download**

**To get the app, just download this jar file from the link,**

It'll add the repository and update the package information list. If you click the button without supplying any repository address, then  **Softylity ** will just update the package information list!

It'll download the key file (in a temp folder) and add the key. Then it'll remove the downloaded key file as it's no longer needed!

It'll  **install ** the package!
-  **Un Installing a package:****  Just enter the package name (e.g  ****notepadqq**** ) ****.Then click on "Uninstall Package" button.**
It'll  **install ** the package! If you want to remove the dependencies as well, just check the " **w/ Dis" ** checkbox!
-  **One click Installation:**  Fill up the repository field (if needed), fill up the key address (if needed) and fill up the package name field (required) and then click " **Add repository and install" ** button.

It'll add the repository (if given), key (if given), and will install the package!
